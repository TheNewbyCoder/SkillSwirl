  <p><h2>How to Play Tile Pong</h2><a href="index.html">Play</a></p><br>
  <p>Welcome to SkillSwirl's guide on how to play Pong! Pong is a classic arcade game that was first released in the 1970s. The game is played by two players who each control a paddle on opposite sides of the screen. The objective of the game is to hit a ball back and forth between the two paddles, with the goal of making the ball go past your opponent's paddle to score a point.</p>
  <h3>Rules of the Game:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The game is played on a rectangular screen divided into two halves, with each player controlling a paddle on their side of the screen. </li>
    <li>The ball starts in the center of the screen and is served by one of the players. </li>
    <li>Players take turns hitting the ball back and forth with their paddles, with the goal of making the ball go past their opponent's paddle to score a point. </li>
    <li>The first player to score a predetermined number of points (usually 11 or 21) wins the game. </li>
    <li>If the ball hits the top or bottom of the screen, it bounces off at an angle. </li>
    <li>If the ball hits the side of the screen, it bounces off at an angle and the player whose paddle the ball hit gets to serve the ball. </li>
    <li>If a player fails to hit the ball with their paddle and the ball goes past their paddle, their opponent scores a point. </li>
  </ul>
